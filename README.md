# Memory Game Project
This a Memory Game created for the Front End Development Nanodegree at Udacity.

## Game
The game consists of our childhood favorite game, the memory game. In this game the user attempts to find matches of all cards by flipping over each card.

## How To Play
To play the game the user must attempt to flip the matching cards one after the other. The user then flips two cards at a time.
* If the cards match, a point is gained and they remained flipped open.
* If the cards do not matched they are flipped over.

This happens until the cards are all matched and flipped over.

Once this happens the user has WON THE GAME and displays score, time, and stars!
